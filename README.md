### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Cloud Solution Architect working at Microsoft _looking for Software Engineering Opportunities_.

- **Developing a full stack app** for tracking books and connecting with other readers that is publicly accesible at [quelees.app](https://quelees.app)
- Made with **React** (with Next.js), **Python** as the API backend, **PostgreSQL** and hosted in **Kubernetes**.
- Long-term project for learning best software engineering practices both in frontend and backend development and steering my career.
